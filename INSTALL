CNonymizer

A short compilation howto.

Prerequisits:
	The boost library. CNonymizer is tested under Linux and Windows
	with library version 1.49. Later versions should do the job too.

	http://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_49_0.html

Compilation requires the following steps:
	autoreconf --install
	./configure
	make

The binary will be in the src/ subdirectory. For the installation
you will need root privileges. Anything else is done with:
	make install
